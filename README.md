About Gopher
======

Utility for turning controller input into mouse movement and click events. Gopher is an excellent tool for PC gaming from the couch, as it's fully capable of web browsing, playing mouse-based games like Runescape, launching emulators, etc.

Newbie Instructions

Click 'Download ZIP' in the bottom-right corner. Inside, you'll find Windows/Gopher/Release/Gopher.exe. I recommend you copy it somewhere outside of the ZIP and make a shortcut to it.
