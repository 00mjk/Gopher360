About Gopher
======

Utility for turning controller input into mouse movement and click events. Gopher is an excellent tool for PC gaming from the couch, as it's fully capable of web browsing, playing mouse-based games like Runescape, launching emulators, etc.

Download Instructions
======
If you don't want to grab it from the 'releases' section at the top, you'll have to download the entire ZIP and get it from the Release folder. Click 'Download ZIP' in the bottom-right corner. Inside, you'll find Windows/Gopher/Release/Gopher.exe. I recommend you copy it somewhere outside of the ZIP and make a shortcut to it. Adding it to your startup folder in your HTPC can make bootups a lot more convenient!
