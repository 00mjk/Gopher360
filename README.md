About Gopher
======

Utility for turning controller input into mouse movement and click events. Gopher is an excellent tool for PC gaming from the couch, as it's fully capable of web browsing, playing mouse-based games like Runescape, launching emulators, etc.

Gopher separates itself from the competition by being efficient, small, portable, free, and fully open. Competitors like XPadder and Joy2Key have their place, but Gopher really gives them a run for their money, even at its initial beta release.
